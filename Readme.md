### CHALLENGES WE FACED AND HOW WE SOLVED THEM

This is the First time to work on a project remotely with a team. We faced some challenges during completion of this project.

We started the project by creating a slack channel which is first and most important task that is connecting with our teammates.This workspace where we can share our work or our ideas.

Followed by that we scheduled our first Google meeting on first day where we discussed how we can further proceed during this whole construct week. We researched the whole website and divided tasks for each.

We recieved all guidans by **Suraj Sir** and **Vaibhavi Mam**

The project has been deployed to Netlify,.It unites an entire ecosystem of modern tools and services into a single, simple workflow for building high performance sites and apps.

After crossing each and every obstacles, we finally completed the PharmaCare website.
